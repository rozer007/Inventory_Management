# Flask Inventory Managment project

## Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy

## Installation

First, you need to clone this repo:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/rozer007/Inventory_Management.git
```

Now, we will need to create a virtual environment and install all the dependencies. We have two options available for now.

Use virtualenv:

```bash
$ pip install virtualenv
```

Or use pip + virtualenv:

```bash
$ virtualenv venv
$ . venv/bin/activate  # on Windows, use "venv\Scripts\activate" instead
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Run the Application?

**Before run the application, make sure you have activated the virtual enviroment:**

```bash
$ flask run
```
